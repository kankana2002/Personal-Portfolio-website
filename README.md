# Personal-Portfolio-website<br>
Created and Designed by Kankana Pandit<br>
Hi! My Fellows ... Today I am making a personal portfolio website using html,css,javascript.<br>
A portfolio website is a unique way to showcase your work and let others know about yourself. Itâ€™s like an evergreen platform for your projects, case studies, and information about you. In addition, itâ€™s one of the best ways to express your personality, experience, and capabilities.

Having your own website means customers are always able to find you and if interested, reach out for you. If you donâ€™t have an online presence nowadays, you are behind the times. ðŸ˜‰ A portfolio is a great way for photographers, designers, developers and a wide range of artists to present their work online. It lets you reflect your identity through your works â€“ photos, graphic design, sketches, etc.<br>

<b>Why You Need a Portfolio Website<b\><br>
In a nutshell, you need a portfolio website to showcase your work. Whether youâ€™re an individual, a small team of two or a company of ten people, itâ€™s crucial that you have a unique online approach. A website portfolio will help you stand out from the crowd, show your uniqueness, build trust, and make sure that others can actually find you.<br>

There are certain areas where a website portfolio is more important than others. If you find yourself in one of the following, itâ€™s safe to assume that you need a portfolio like a book needs words:<br>

Web design<br>
Web development (outsourcing, online shop)<br>
Graphic design (logo design, corporate ID, flyers, catalogs, packaging)<br>
Marketing (digital marketing, print design, SEO, PPC advertising)<br>
Art design (illustration, video, audio, photography)<br>
But it doesnâ€™t stop just there, the same goes with interior designers, artists, models, writers, etc. The main idea is that you are a creator and you need to showcase your work. Portfolio website lets you do that in high quality.<br>
